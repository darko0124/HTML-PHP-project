Library DB project (HTML+PHP+SQL)

In this project i had to make a database ( used SQL for managing the base and requests that are send to it). 
You can execute main functions like Insert, Update, Delete, Select so you can retrive the data that you would like.
The GUI is written in PHP. It's very simple but working properly.

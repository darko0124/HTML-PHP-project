# HTML-PHP-project
Library DB project (HTML+PHP+SQL)

In this project i had to make a database ( used SQL for managing the base and requests that are send to it). 
You can execute main functions like Insert, Update, Delete, Select so you can retrive and manage the data however you like.
The GUI is written in PHP. It's very simple and user friendly and it works properly.
